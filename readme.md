# Tegridy 2D Pool Controller
![Tegridy](./0.png)
## About
The TegridyPool package provides a basic 2D pool framework for deploying your own Pool/Snooker inspired games. Levels, balls and players can be configured in a number of ways enabling a great deal of variety from this simple controller. 
## Usage
We recommend taking a look at the example scene to get an idea of how the scene is composed and setup. You will have two main objects, one a GUI Canvas for the menu’s and overlays  and the other will contain your tables, cues and characters. This last object should be left active when you call StartUp on the TegridyPool component. If you have the StandAlone component configured in your scene the menu will load automatically, if not you will need to call the TegridyPool component in your script as shown in the StandAlone script. The package also contains blueprints for a complete game ready to be started, and the main components for making your own levels. I would recommend looking at these blueprints before creating your own.

- TableSelectTitle – When found this is used to display the table select heading found in the language controller.
- TableSelectBack – This should be set a Button object and will take the player back to the main menu. If a TextMeshPro object is found it will also use the relevant strings found in the language controller.
- ScrollContent – This should be set to the content of a scroll view component and contain a prefab to be used in the level select
- TablePrefab – This should be set to an image containing the GUI object that make up the level information
- PrefabSpacing – how far apart the prefabs should be spaced apart when generated by the application.

- TableUI – This will provide an overlay for the table, the overlay used should have the same amount of players and balls as the table does. 
- Players – How many players are on the table, your ball  ID’s should go one higher otherwise a final ball will not be found.
- CueBall – A game object with a TegridyPoolCueBall component and a 2D collider.
- BallHolder – the parent object that contains the balls for this table. All balls should have a TegridyPoolBall component added, and the balls group ID should end one higher than the player count. The final ID will be used as the last ball the players will need to pot.
- Pocket Holder – the parent object that contains the pockets that the balls will interact with on that table and each of these should have a TegridyPoolPocket component.
- Audio – The audioclips to be used at different stages in the game.
- For each table you will also need to add a sprite object with a collider that represents the tables boundaries. And one without a collider that will act as the table itself. 

## Cue Configuration

Each TegridyPoolCue component should be placed on a sprite component that represents the in game pool cue complete with an AudiosSource.
- CueName / Description – Can be set in the editor, or if the number of cues in the scene matches the length of the arrays in TegridyPoolLanguage then they will be used instead to provide the GUI’s strings.

After StartUp has been called you can open the main menu by passing OpenMainMenu a configured GUI, host can be left null but if it is set that object will be disabled when the menu is opened and set active again once the game has been quit usefull if implementing into your own systems.
